Brain tissue iron neurophysiology and its relationship with the cognitive effects of dopaminergic modulation in children with and without ADHD
# Conclusions


# Methods
- The dataset for the proposed study is a subset of 65 participants with ADHD and TD participants between the ages of 8â€“12 years who participated in a larger study assessing the effects of MPH administration on functional brain network organization (ADHD: n = 36, 17 F, mean age = 9.70 y; TD: n = 29, 12 F, mean age = 10.23 y).

- Each MRI session included an MPRAGE anatomical T1-weighted scan 
- and the following T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging (EPI) functional scans: 
	- two resting-state scans (five minutes each), 
	- two standard go/no-go task scans (6.5 min each)
	- and four rewarded go/no-go task scans (six minutes each), administered in that order. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=3&selection=61,0,95,6|cascone2023, page 3]]
- 3. Go/no-go tasks and measures Two versions of a go/no-go task, a standard and a rewarded version, were administered. The versions of the go/no-go task we used were adapted from one that was initially designed to have a high proportion of errors (Winter and Sheridan, 2014).
