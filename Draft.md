# Abstract

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ([[ADHD]]) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by <strong>inattentiveness</strong>, <strong>hyperactivity</strong>, and <strong>impulsivity</strong>. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=514R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]] There is a rapidly growing body of research regarding all aspects of [[ADHD]], both in the basic and clinical sciences. The goal of this review is to compound this information, including the <strong>anatomy</strong>, <strong>pathophysiology</strong>, and <strong>clinical presentations</strong> of [[ADHD]].

# Background

## Introduction
Symptoms of [[ADHD]] are classified as either <strong>Inattention</strong> or <strong>Hyperactivity/Impulsivity</strong>. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&selection=22,28,22,63|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]] Inattention symptoms include carelessness [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=531R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]], distractibility [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=579R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]], easily sidetracked [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=552R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]], disorganization [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=555R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]], misplaces necessary items often [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=576R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]], and forgetfulness [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=585R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]]. Hyperactivity symptoms include restlessness [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=588R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]], impulsivity [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=606R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]], impatience [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=612R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]], intrusiveness [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=618R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]], inability to play quietly [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=597R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]], and excessive talking [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=603R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]]. Symptoms usually start in childhood and may persist into adulthood if left untreated. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=7&annotation=639R|DSM-5_Part2, page 7]] The [[DSM-5]] revised the [[ADHD]] diagnostic criteria regarding symptoms, age of onset, and symptom exclusivity. The number of symptoms required for diagnosis in either category (inattention or hyperactivity) has been <strong>reduced from 6 to 5 for older adolescents/adults</strong>. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=4&annotation=525R|DSM-5_Part2, page 4]] Age of onset has raised the age limit for <strong>initial symptom onset from 7 to 12</strong>. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=5&annotation=621R|DSM-5_Part2, page 5]] [[ADHD]] is often treated with medication, therapy, or a combination of both to help manage the symptoms and improve daily functioning for affected individuals.

## Prevalence


 The prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) in children and adolescents is an important topic, given that treatment options for this condition are increasing in the U.S. Accurate measurements of [[ADHD]] rates across different groups, locations, and regions can help inform decisions made by healthcare providers, policymakers, and public health officials on how best to allocate resources to manage and control this psychiatric disorder. [[zgodic2023.pdf#page=1&annotation=1419R|zgodic2023, page 1]] Studies show that the prevalence of [[ADHD]] is quite high among children and adolescents. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&annotation=883R|ayano2023, page 1]] Based on meta-analytical data, it has been estimated that approximately <strong>5% to 10% of school-aged children in the U.S.</strong> have been diagnosed with this condition. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&annotation=892R|ayano2023, page 1]] 
 
 These rates are not only high but also show a significant degree of <strong>geographic variation</strong> across different regions and sociodemographic groups. [[cortese2023.pdf#page=3&annotation=595R|cortese2023, page 3]] Researchers have also identified "hot spots" or areas with higher prevalence rates of [[ADHD]], as well as "cold spots," or those regions that seem to exhibit lower than average incidence of the disorder. [[zgodic2023.pdf#page=6&annotation=1429R|zgodic2023, page 6]] By identifying these patterns, healthcare providers can better target resources to support and improve care for individuals and their families within their geographical jurisdiction, whether this includes medication, psychosocial interventions, or educational supports. [[zgodic2023.pdf#page=7&annotation=1439R|zgodic2023, page 7]]

## Causes
Potential causes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) involve abnormalities in brain structure and function [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=13&annotation=1323R|sonugabarke2022, page 13]], along with genetic factors [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=9&annotation=1333R|sonugabarke2022, page 9]]. Although the exact cause remains under investigation, new data points to a genetic component. [[sapkale2023.pdf#page=8&annotation=277R|sapkale2023, page 8]] Along with genetic factors, structural and functional defects of the brain are thought to influence the development of [[ADHD]]. [[sapkale2023.pdf#page=8&annotation=274R|sapkale2023, page 8]] These abnormalities may include issues with [[Dopamine]] levels, white matter tracts, and [[Prefrontal Cortex]] functioning. [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=14&annotation=1363R|sonugabarke2022, page 14]] Furthermore, research suggests that exposure to environmental factors such as lead poisoning, prenatal alcohol exposure, and smoking during pregnancy can increase the risk for [[ADHD]] in offspring. [[sapkale2023.pdf#page=5&annotation=283R|sapkale2023, page 5]] However, the precise mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=11&annotation=1383R|sonugabarke2022, page 11]] In conclusion, [[ADHD]] has numerous potential causes rooted in brain abnormalities, genetics, and environmental factors. While the exact etiology remains elusive, ongoing research continues to shed light on this complex disorder.

## RiskFactors
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children that has been associated with several risk factors. These risk factors can be categorized into genetic, environmental, socioeconomic, maternal smoking, and low birth weight factors. Genetic factors have been identified as one of the primary causes of [[ADHD]]. Studies have shown that individuals with a family history of [[ADHD]] are more likely to develop the disorder themselves. [[claussen2022.pdf#page=15&annotation=691R|claussen2022, page 15]] Additionally, certain genes have been linked to an increased risk of developing [[ADHD]], such as those involved in [[Dopamine]] regulation and synaptic transmission.  Environmental factors also play a significant role in the development of [[ADHD]]. Exposure to environmental toxins such as lead, and mercury has been associated with an increased risk of developing the disorder. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=7&annotation=645R|DSM-5_Part2, page 7]] Furthermore, factors like poor nutrition, exposure to pollution, and traumatic experiences can all contribute to the development of [[ADHD]]. [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=11&annotation=1393R|sonugabarke2022, page 11]] Socioeconomic factors, particularly living in disadvantaged conditions or having a low socioeconomic status, have also been linked to an increased risk of developing [[ADHD]]. [[sonugabarke2022.pdf#page=11&annotation=1393R|sonugabarke2022, page 11]] This may be due to stress and unsupportive home environments. Additionally, lower access to healthcare services in underserved areas could hinder the timely diagnosis and treatment of [[ADHD]]. [[zgodic2023.pdf#page=7&annotation=1439R|zgodic2023, page 7]] Maternal smoking during pregnancy has also been identified as a risk factor for [[ADHD]]. [[DSM-5_Part2.pdf#page=7&annotation=651R|DSM-5_Part2, page 7]] Exposure to [[Nicotine]] and other chemicals found in tobacco can alter the normal development of the fetal brain, leading to an increased risk of developing [[ADHD]]. [[polli2022.pdf#page=1&annotation=1908R|polli2022, page 1]] However, this risk has been shown to be potentially confounded by genetic risk as well. [[tarver2014.pdf#page=2&annotation=108R|tarver2014, page 2]] Finally, low birth weight is another risk factor associated with [[ADHD]]. Infants born weighing less than 5 pounds may have altered brain development and be more prone to developing [[ADHD]] later in life. [[tarver2014.pdf#page=2&annotation=114R|tarver2014, page 2]] In conclusion, there are several risk factors that contribute to the development of [[ADHD]] in children. These include genetic factors, environmental exposures, socioeconomic status, maternal smoking during pregnancy, and low birth weight. By understanding these risk factors, healthcare professionals can work towards developing appropriate preventative and therapeutic strategies for individuals at high risk of developing [[ADHD]].

## Comorbidities

Comorbidities are co-occurring conditions that can be present in individuals diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]). These comorbidities may impact the presentation, prognosis, and treatment of [[ADHD]]. Some common comorbidities associated with [[ADHD]] include other neuropsychiatric disorders, conduct problems, substance use disorders, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders. [[silva2023.pdf#page=2&annotation=207R|silva2023, page 2]] The presence of comorbid conditions in patients with [[ADHD]] has been found to negatively impact various outcomes, including symptom severity, quality of life, and overall functioning. [[roh2023.pdf#page=7&annotation=144R|roh2023, page 7]] It is essential to note that comorbidities may require separate or additional treatment interventions beyond those targeting [[ADHD]] symptoms. Consequently, proper evaluation, diagnosis, and management of comorbid conditions are crucial for optimal outcomes in patients with [[ADHD]].

# Anatomy

## Amygdala

The [[Amygdala]], which is located within the limbic system, is a small almond-shaped structure found deep within the brain. [[Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&annotation=623R|Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] It plays a crucial role in regulating emotions, fear responses, and the storage of memories, particularly those associated with negative or traumatic experiences. [[Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=2&annotation=629R|Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 2]] The [[Amygdala]]'s diverse structure consists of five major functional groups: basolateral nuclei, cortical-like nuclei, central nuclei, other [[Amygdala|amygdaloid]] nuclei, and extended [[Amygdala]]. [[Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&annotation=635R|Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] The [[Amygdala]] is connected to other parts of the brain involved in emotional regulation, such as the [[Prefrontal Cortex]] and the [[Hypothalamus]], allowing it to coordinate its activity with other areas. [[Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=2&annotation=641R|Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 2]] Damage to the [[Amygdala]] has been linked to several mental health disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. [[Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=3&annotation=647R|Neuroanatomy, Amygdala - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 3]] Understanding the anatomy of the [[Amygdala]] can help medical professionals better diagnose, treat, and care for patients with these conditions.  
  

Prior studies have shown associations between abnormalities of the [[Amygdala]] and irritability. [[suk2023.pdf#page=7&annotation=1745R|suk2023, page 7]] Irritability is associated with several psychiatric disorders, including [[ADHD]]. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=2&annotation=494R|mukherjee2022, page 2]] Suk et al took an additional step, exploring the associations of irritability with activation of the [[Amygdala]], and the associations of facial expression processing with activation of the [[Amygdala]]. They recruited 59 children with disruptive mood and behavior disorder aged 10-18 with a self-reported [[Affective Reactivity Index (ARI)]] of at least 4. [[suk2023.pdf#page=3&selection=34,0,102,4|suk2023, page 3]] Major findings include increased activation in several regions of the brain in response to positive and negative facial expressions (happiness and fear). The regions of the brain were the right [[Amygdala]], right [[Precuneus]], right [[Cingulate Gyrus]], bilateral [[Cerebellum]], right [[Superior Frontal Gyrus]], right [[Middle Occipital Gyrus]], and [[Middle Temporal Gyrus]]. [[suk2023.pdf#page=1&annotation=1713R|suk2023, page 1]]

The study aimed to examine the relationship between irritability in [[ADHD]]-Combined Presentation and altered functional connectivity. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=3&selection=158,0,162,30|mukherjee2022, page 3]] Functional connectivity was measured using [[Resting-state fMRI]] of the [[Amygdala]] and [[Nucleus Accumbens]] in [[ADHD]] patients aged 12-23. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=5&selection=4,0,5,1|mukherjee2022, page 5]] Irritability was positively correlated with atypical functional connectivity. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=2&selection=151,71,152,40|mukherjee2022, page 2]] The [[Amygdala]] had greater connectivity with the right [[Inferior Frontal Gyrus]] and [[Caudate]]/[[Putamen]], and less functional connectivity with the [[Precuneus]]. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=2&selection=143,75,144,93|mukherjee2022, page 2]] The [[Nucleus Accumbens]] showed a positive correlation bewteen irritability and greater functional connectivity with the left [[Posterior Middle Temporal Gyrus]] and [[Precuneus]]. [[mukherjee2022.pdf#page=6&selection=49,11,54,24|mukherjee2022, page 6]]

## Basal Ganglia
The [[Basal Ganglia]] consist of several, adjacent structures deep to the [[Cerebrum]]. [[Neuroanatomy, Basal Ganglia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&selection=43,0,43,82|Neuroanatomy, Basal Ganglia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] These structures are the [[Striatum]], [[Subthalamic Nucleus]], and [[Substantia Nigra]]. The [[Striatum]] contains the [[Caudate]], [[Nucleus Accumbens]], [[Olfactory Tubercle]], and [[Lenticular Nuclei]]. The [[Lenticular Nuclei]] are the [[Putamen]], [[Globus Pallidus Externus]], and [[Globus Pallidus Internus]]. [[Neuroanatomy, Basal Ganglia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&selection=57,84,61,30|Neuroanatomy, Basal Ganglia - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]]

Tang et al investigated the association between [[Basal Ganglia]] morphology and motor response control. [[tang2019.pdf#page=1&selection=52,1,54,0|tang2019, page 1]] [[ADHD]] children aged 8-12 were evaluated via [[go+no-go]] tasks and shape-based morphometric analyses of [[T1-weighted 3D MPRAGE]] images using a 3T scanner. [[tang2019.pdf#page=1&selection=64,0,79,1|tang2019, page 1]] The results showed decreased volumes and inward deformation of the [[Putamen]] and dorsal [[Globus Pallidus]] in male, [[ADHD]] children relative to male controls. [[tang2019.pdf#page=2&selection=0,1,3,0|tang2019, page 2]] The same findings were absent in female, [[ADHD]] children relative to female controls. There was also a positive correlation between decreased volume/inward deformation of these structures and poorer motor response control. [[tang2019.pdf#page=2&selection=10,0,14,28|tang2019, page 2]]

Shvarzman et al used [[Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)]] to investigate levels of iron deposition in the [[Basal Ganglia]] and their association with [[ADHD]]. [[shvarzman2022.pdf#page=1&selection=59,0,60,90|shvarzman2022, page 1]] They recruited [[ADHD]] children aged 8-12 for [[Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)|DTI]] of their brains, and also utilized brain-behavior analyses. [[shvarzman2022.pdf#page=1&selection=59,0,60,90|shvarzman2022, page 1]] They found that [[ADHD]] children had reduced iron in the bilateral limbic [[Striatum]]. [[shvarzman2022.pdf#page=1&selection=63,1,65,22|shvarzman2022, page 1]] Lower tissue-iron levels in the bilateral limbic [[Striatum]] correlated with anxious, depressive, and affective symptom severity. [[shvarzman2022.pdf#page=2&selection=7,0,16,0|shvarzman2022, page 2]]

Cascone et al used [[MRI]] and [[fMRI]] to assess intrinsic dopamine availability in the [[Basal Ganglia]] and [[Thalamus]] of [[ADHD]] children aged 8-12. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=1&selection=90,58,97,37|cascone2023, page 1]] The [[ADHD]]-only participants also underwent a crossover [[Methylphenidate]] challenge. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=1&selection=99,0,104,14|cascone2023, page 1]] They found that increased iron in the [[Putamen]] was negatively associated with successful response inhibition regardless of [[ADHD]]-status. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=1&selection=107,64,111,0|cascone2023, page 1]] During their crossover challenge, they also found that higher [[Putamen]] and [[Caudate]] iron levels positively correlated with better response to [[Methylphenidate]]. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=1&selection=111,1,115,86|cascone2023, page 1]] This was seen in the [[ADHD]] children's improved task performance with [[Methylphenidate]]. [[cascone2023.pdf#page=1&selection=116,0,118,54|cascone2023, page 1]]

## Caudate
The caudate nucleus is a crucial subcortical structure in the brain, located in the striatum of the basal ganglia, lateral to the thalamus. [[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&selection=43,0,45,66|Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] It consists of three parts - the anterior head, body, and tail, which work together with the putamen to contribute to cognitive, emotional, and learning processes. [[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&selection=45,66,49,76|Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] The caudate head is connected to the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices and manages memory acquisition, storage, retrieval, and manipulation. [[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=2&selection=8,0,10,22|Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 2]] The caudate body and tail modulate learning acquisition. [[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=2&selection=50,0,52,54|Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 2]] Their neurons primarily consist of GABAergic medium spiny neurons that inhibit other basal ganglia structures. [[Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf.pdf#page=1&selection=79,0,81,133|Neuroanatomy, Nucleus Caudate - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, page 1]] 

Greven et al conducted a cross-sectional study with the goal of detecting associations with brain structure volume with ADHD. [[greven2015.pdf#page=2&selection=112,0,116,37|greven2015, page 2]] They used brain MRI data from the Dutch NeuroIMAGE sample dataset of ADHD children and adult patients, unaffected siblings, and typically developing control individuals. [[greven2015.pdf#page=2&selection=126,0,138,42|greven2015, page 2]] They were measuring volumes of the whole brain, along with the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, globus pallidus, hippocampus, thalamus, and brainstem. [[greven2015.pdf#page=1&selection=35,1,38,72|greven2015, page 1]] The findings in ADHD patients consisted of a 2.5% decrease in total brain volume of ADHD patients, 3% decrease in total gray matter volume. [[greven2015.pdf#page=1&selection=42,1,53,10|greven2015, page 1]] Unaffected siblings had increased total brain volume relative to ADHD patients, but still decreased total brain volume relative to typically developing controls. [[greven2015.pdf#page=1&selection=59,1,60,35|greven2015, page 1]] Age appeared to be negatively associated with caudate and putamen volumes in typically developing controls. [[greven2015.pdf#page=1&selection=60,35,68,57|greven2015, page 1]] However, in ADHD patients and their unaffected siblings, age had no statistically significant association with caudate/putamen volumes. [[greven2015.pdf#page=1&selection=68,58,69,64|greven2015, page 1]] 

Dang et al aimed to clarify the relationship between caudate asymmetry and ADHD symptoms. [[dang2016.pdf#page=1&selection=55,0,62,36|dang2016, page 1]] T1-weighted MRI scans of adults aged 18-35 were analyzed for caudate asymmetry. [[dang2016.pdf#page=1&selection=63,1,65,62|dang2016, page 1]]
