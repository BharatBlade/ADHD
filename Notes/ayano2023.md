The global prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: An umbrella review of meta-analyses

# Conclusions
- First, the international [[prevalence]] of [[ADHD]] is high in <strong>children and adolescents (8 %)</strong> with relatively comparable prevalence across the globe except in Black, White, and Asian Americans as well as in India and the Middle East countries. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=5&selection=52,38,57,66|ayano2023, page 5]]
- Second, the prevalence of ADHD was twice higher in boys (10 %) than in girls (5 %). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=6&selection=9,0,10,21|ayano2023, page 6]]
- Third, in terms of the subtypes of ADHD, the review showed that the inattentive type of [[ADHD]] was the commonest type of ADHD (ADHD-I) (3 %) followed by the hyperactive type (ADHD-HI) (2.95 %) and the combined type (ADHD-C) (2.44). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=6&selection=16,0,19,30|ayano2023, page 6]]

# Methods
- We systematically searched [[PubMed]], [[Web of Science]], [[PsychINFO]], and [[Scopus]] to find pertinent studies. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=84,0,84,99|ayano2023, page 1]]
- The quality of the studies was assessed using a <strong>Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews</strong> ([[AMSTAR]]) [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=85,60,86,56|ayano2023, page 1]]
- <strong>Prevalence estimates</strong> from the included studies were pooled using <strong>invariance variance weighted random-effect meta-analysis</strong>. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=86,58,87,75|ayano2023, page 1]] (Probably Inverse variance weighted ([[IVW]]) meta-analysis)
- International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews ([[PROSPERO]]) (CRD42023389704). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=2&selection=125,55,137,17|ayano2023, page 2]]
- The <strong>search was performed using the following relevant search terms</strong>: (i) [[ADHD]], attention deficit hyeractivity disorders; (ii) [[prevalence]], epidemiology, rates; (iii) adolescent, children; and (iv) Systematic review, meta-analyses, quantitative synthesis, systematic literature review. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=2&selection=147,45,165,49|ayano2023, page 2]]
- <strong>Cochrane’s Q and I<sup>2</sup> test</strong> were conducted to evaluate the <strong>heterogeneity across the studies</strong> (Borenstein et al., 2010). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=2&selection=229,38,236,14|ayano2023, page 2]]
- The presence of <strong>potential publication bias</strong> was assessed graphically using a <strong>funnel plot</strong> and statistically using <strong>Egger’s</strong> [[ayano2023.pdf#page=2&selection=246,24,249,1|ayano2023, page 2]]

# Results
- Thirteen meta-analytic systematic reviews (588 primary studies) with 3,277,590 participants were included in the final analysis. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=91,0,92,32|ayano2023, page 1]]
- A random effect meta-analysis of these studies showed that the <strong>global prevalence of ADHD in children and adolescents was 8.0 %</strong> (95%CI 6.0–10 %). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=92,33,95,6|ayano2023, page 1]]
- The <strong>prevalence estimate was twice higher in boys (10 %)</strong> compared to girls (5 %). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=95,7,96,36|ayano2023, page 1]]
- Of the three subtypes of [[ADHD]], the <strong>inattentive type of ADHD (ADHD-I) was found to be the most common</strong> type of [[ADHD]] followed by the hyperactive ([[ADHD]]-HI) and the combined types ([[ADHD]]-C). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=96,37,98,9|ayano2023, page 1]]
- The <strong>AMSTAR tool</strong> was used to examine the methodological quality of the included systematic review and meta-analytic studies. <strong>Three reviews (23.08 %) had a medium</strong> quality score, <strong>10 (76.92 %) reviews had high</strong> quality, and <strong>no review had low</strong> quality [[ayano2023.pdf#page=4&selection=19,0,22,39|ayano2023, page 4]]
- The <strong>heterogeneity</strong> across the studies was <strong>significant</strong> [[ayano2023.pdf#page=4&selection=36,7,37,33|ayano2023, page 4]]
- There is <strong>no evidence for publication bias</strong> [[ayano2023.pdf#page=4&selection=50,17,50,59|ayano2023, page 4]]

# Miscellaneous
- For example, a 2019 study by Zhao and colleagues found that the <strong>economic burden of raising children and adolescents with DAHD was five times higher</strong> than raising children without [[ADHD]]. [[ayano2023.pdf#page=1&selection=130,27,137,4|ayano2023, page 1]]
- According to the <strong>World Federation of ADHD International Consensus Statement</strong> that offered 208 evidence-based conclusions about the disorder, there are widespread misconceptions and stigma regrading [[ADHD]] and the [[prevalence]] <strong>of</strong> [[ADHD]] <strong>in children and adolescent ranged from 5.9 to 14%</strong> (Faraone et al., 2021). [[ayano2023.pdf#page=2&selection=4,61,11,23|ayano2023, page 2]]
- In addition, the reviews reported <strong>inconsistent findings ranging from 3.4 to 14 %</strong> (C´enat et al., 2022; Polanczyk et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2015; Vasileva et al., 2021).
